# Proacademy iOS App

One of my iOS native app projects. This one is for ProAcademy business allowing to browse makeup courses, book them with couple of extra things such as 
artists gallery.
It works with Contentful headless CMS as backend so to run it one needs to setup own space and create proper model with content.
